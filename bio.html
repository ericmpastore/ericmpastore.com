<h2>Career History and Case Studies</h2>
<p><strong>Give a man a fish, and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he will fall asleep in class and fail the final.</strong></p>

<p>Training, both design and delivery, is a difficult but vital role in many modern industries. This is especially true in regulated industries such as medical devices and transport. Designing and developing a good course requires both a knowledge of subject matter and the end user, and the wisdom to bridge the knowledge gap.</p>

<p>The case studies below speak to challenges I've faced in industry. Some are training and documentation focused, while others deal with the wonderful world of professional interaction. In short: it's been a ride. Enjoy the stories below and leave feedback if you want to discuss further.</p>

<p><strong>Note: The following entries demonstrate my work as a technical trainer and writer/communicator.

	<p>Talking About Gerunds</p>
	<p><strong>A <em>Gerund</em> is a word verb form ending in -ing. Examples including 'walking,' 'talking,' and 'working.' For many years, it was common practice for technical communicators to use gerunds in procedures, especially when referring to an action performed by the user. In the modern world of online help, however, it makes more sense to use imperative forms of words such as 'walk' and 'talk' because these terms more closely match a user's search terms. On my former Tech Pubs team it was written in our style guide to use gerunds for procedure titles. The team, however, only wrote paper manuals. What do you think?

<h2>On-board Cab Signal Basic Maintenance Course</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<div><img src="media/cab_signal_flowchart.png" width="452" height="390" alt="flowchart for the cab signal process" /><p>Figure 1: Cab Signal Process</p></div>
<p>Cab signaling is a crucial safety measure to ensure trains maintain appropriate speeds and separation. Without cab signaling, or signaling in general, trains could exceed authorized speeds in a rail system. This could result in rear-end collisions or derailments causing loss of life and equipment.</p>

<p>A cab signal is an electrical signal injected into the rails on which the train runs. Special antennas on the train pick up the signal from the rails, which is then processed by the on-board cab signal system. A basic cab signal system will then display an <em>aspect</em> to the train operator, which is a dedicated symbol indicating the speed limit of the train. Aspects are displayed on the Aspect Display Unit (ADU), a special component in the cab of the train. For more information on the ADU, see the <strong>Disassembling the Aspect Display Unit (ADU)</strong> section.</p>

<p>A basic cab signal system will only display speed limit information to the operator, but will not take action. Many modern on-board cab signal systems incorporate Automatic Train Control (ATC) functionality to also enforce speed limits. In this configuration, the cab signal system will pick up the signal from the rails and display an aspect, but will also monitor the speed of the train to ensure safe speeds. If the operator does not obey the speed limit, the cab signal system will request an application of the train's brakes to slow or stop the train.</p>

<p>In summary, a cab signal system with ATC functionality performs the functions described in <em>Figure 1</em>.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The company built an on-board cab signal system for a new rail car used on a major commuter line. The contract required that basic maintenance training be given to customer personnel once the system was ready to be put into revenue service. To fulfill the contract, the publications team developed a training plan, course outlines, and draft PowerPoint slides for customer submission.</p>

<p>The customer responded with comments on the course, but time and turnover meant that a completely different team and instructor (myself) received the comments. The new team faced several challenges and addressed each challenge with a different approach. <strong>Table 1</strong> lists each challenge, a description of the challenge, and the solution that the team used to overcome the challenge.</p>

<table>
	<caption>Table 1 - Cab Signal Course Development Challenges and Solutions</caption>
	<tr>
		<th>Challenge</th>
		<th>Description</th>
		<th>Solution</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Limited Project Experience</td>
		<td>The team had little experience with both the installed system and the intricacies of the project.  The system was based on an existing product, but customized to the customer's unique application. Also, the project had years of history unknown to the team.</td>
		<td>The instructor consulted with the SMEs through interviews, emails, document reviews, and informal conversations to gain information. The SMEs included both the project engineer and engineering manager. This information included both how the system worked, as well as what major events had happened over the course of the multi-year project. The instructor also interfaced with the system directly to gain hands-on, practical knowledge.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Incomplete Analysis:</td>
		<td>The previous team had not performed important instructional design tasks such as audience and gap analysis. Critical information about the customer's training needs was not available, and needed to be discovered by the new team.</td>
		<td>The instructor consulted with the car builder and the end customer to determine the end customer's true needs. This communication occurred through document reviews, conference calls, and on-site working sessions.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Multiple Stakeholders:</td>
		<td>The project served two customers: the builder of the rail car and the end customer who would operate the rail car. The comments from these two customers could sometimes be different.</td>
		<td>Arguably the most difficult issue, the instructor used the available communication channels to speak with both customers (together when possible) and discover the true priorities.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>After multiple revisions and one pilot training class, the final course materials began to take shape. While the customer was still free to comment on the course materials, the overall structure of the course was established. Once the instructor delivered the pilot course, an initial first course was delivered and accepted by the customer. This opened the opportunity for further courses and the conclusion of the cab signal training contract requirement.</p>

<h2>Replacing and Configuring the Ethernet Switch in a Wayside Control Center</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Modern ATC systems use several data communication technologies to send and receive information. Systems in the past used mostly serial connections, with slower transmission speeds. Modern systems use networking technologies such as Ethernet to send and receive data over the large distances of a rail system Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN).</p>

<p>Traffic control is an essential part of any network LAN or WAN. Data are sent over the network in the form of packets. Packets all travel on the same network media and can collide if not controlled. Data is lost when collisions occur and must be resent, resulting in heavier demands on the network and lower speeds.</p>

<p>An Ethernet switch performs many network traffic control functions. Switches receive data packets from other systems on the network and send each packet to the appropriate destination. This strategy controls the flow of data on a network, resulting in fewer collisions and better network speeds.</p>

<p>The Ethernet switch in <em>Figure 2</em> is a standard switch used in many industrial and transport applications.</p>

<div><img src="media/ethernet_switch.jpg" alt="picture of a Moxa ethernet switch" width="430" height="200" title="Moxa Ethernet Switch" /><p>Figure 2: Moxa Ethernet Switch (Source: Moxa)</p></div>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Ethernet switches are used extensively in commuter rail applications. Switches are usually Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) models made by Cisco, Moxa, Dell, and others. These Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) include extensive documentation with their products, but these resources are not always enough to address the maintenance needs of a customer.</p>

<p>One customer decided that the OEM documentation did not adequately explain how to replace a failed switch. Maintenance personnel needed to know not only how to reconfigure the switch, but how to safely remove it from its location in an equipment rack, what tool to use for reconfiguration, and exactly what configuration data to use. This was not available in the OEM documentation.</p>

<p>The publications team added four detailed procedures to a project manual which included the OEM documentation. These procedures were replacement and configuration procedures for the two models of switches in use on the rail system LAN. The replacement procedure describes the location of the switches, the safest method to shut down the rack where they are kept, and how to replace a failed switch with a working switch. The configuration procedure describes the configuration tool and how to upload new configuration files. A table in the appendix contains specific configuration data for each switch, including IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.</p>

<p><em>Procedure 1</em> is a sample procedure describing the steps to replace a failed switch in an equipment rack.</p>

<h3>Procedure 1: Replacing the Ethernet Switch</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Shut down the system rack by moving the power switch to the Off position. <em class="result">The rack and the installed switch will shut down.</em></li>
	<li>Remove the eight (8) phillips-head screws securing the switch to the system rack and disconnect the rear cables. <em class="result">The maintainer can now remove the switch from the system rack.</em></li>
	<li>Install the new switch in the system rack using the guide rails. When the switch is fully inserted, secure the switch to the system rack using the eight (8) phillips-head screws removed in the previous step. Connect the rear wires to the new switch. <em class="result">The switch is now ready to start up.</em></li>
	<li>Start up the system rack by moving the power switch to the On position. <em class="result">The rack and the installed switch will start up.</em></li>

<h2>Disassembling the Aspect Display Unit (ADU)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Aspect Display Unit (ADU) is an important interface between the cab signal system on the train and the train operator. Recall from the <em>On-board Cab Signal Basic Maintenance Course</em> section that cab signaling is a crucial safety measure to ensure trains maintain appropriate speeds and separation. The cab signal system picks up an electrical signal from the running rails which it then processes into a speed indication, or aspect, for the operator.</p>

<p>Once a signal is received, the aspect for that signal is then displayed until a new signal is received. If the signal is lost or becomes noise, the cab signal system will display the most restrictive aspect indicating the slowest speed. <em>Figure 3</em> is a basic ADU in a train cab.</p>

<p>The ADU can also display other information from the cab signal system to the operator. This includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Maximum speed limit</li>
	<li>Cab signal system state (enabled/disabled)</li>
	<li>Braking indications</li>
</ul>

<div><img src="media/adu.jpg" alt="picture of an aspect display unit" width="462" height="334" /><p>Figure 3: Cab Signal ADU (Source: <a href="http://www.nyctransitforums.com/forums" target="_blank">NYC Transit Forums</a>)</p></div>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The company built an on-board cab signal system for a new rail car used on a major commuter line. After the system was put into service, the customer requested several dissassembly procedures for various components. The publications team then developed several procedures for the components, including assembly and disassembly procedures for the ADU. The procedures were delivered to the customer as stand-alone documents intended for a larger manual.</p>

<p>The author of the procedures (myself) sourced the technical content through hands-on experience with the ADU. Most manuals are sourced from engineering documentation, drawings, and other documentation sources and reviewed by engineering staff, but the ADU had no accessible documentation. As a result, the author was forced to simply perform the procedure and document each step.</p>

<p>The author disassembled the ADU down to each individual component on the parts list using hand tools commonly available to the customer's electricians. Each major step of the procedure directed the electrician to assemble/disassemble a particular component, identified on a graphic. Sub-steps then gave additional details on the particular method to assemble/disassemble the component. At the end of the assembly procedure, the electrician would safely install a complete ADU in the train cab (Figure 3). At the end of the disassembly procedure, the electrician would have a set of parts which would allow for easy troubleshooting and replacement. The author also added appropriate Warnings and Cautions (after consulting company safety experts) to prevent harm to the electrician or damage to the ADU.</p>

<p>The author wrote the document in Microsoft Word 2010 using graphics lightly modified in Adobe Illlustrator CS6. Though the publications team had an established template and styles, the document was written using the format and styles of the customer manual. This strategy ensured that the content would be easy to incorporate into the end user's documentation.</p> <!--<em>Procedure 3</em> is a sample procedure which describes basic steps to disassemble the ADU.</p>-->
