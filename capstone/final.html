<h2>Design+ Certification Training Plan</h2>

Needs Assessment

Based on research conducted in the Analysis phase of the Capstone Project, the primary issue to solve with training is Technical Debt, a term used by several engineers to describe the hacks and shortcuts developers use to complete code projects on time and under budget. Technical Debt is a lack of best practices, and results in code that works but is difficult to understand, maintain, and update. Technical Debt leads to problems on many projects because the code is difficult to understand by the developer or is simply not built well enough to allow for future development. Time is wasted fixing problems and relearning solutions rather than building value-added features.

Developers need training in standard design methodologies and best practices. A professional certification, adopted by the software industry, will provide a standard framework for employer validation of developer skills in these areas. A professional certification will also drive necessary change in how developers are educated and trained.


Business Goals

A lack of developers skills in design and best practices drives other issues in industry which draing time and resources. Of the issues identified in the Capstone Project, difficulty of maintaining legacy systems (3%), unnecessarily complex systems (2%), and scalability driving complexity (2%) are all impacted by this skill gap. This skill gap particularly affects project planning, since project managers plan for normal development activities but do not take into account the extra work required to fix an architecture.

Performance Objectives

(develop specific objectives explaining what certified developers will be able to do)

Audience

(describe developer audience, along with functional and project managers)

Prerequisites

(explain skills, education, experience that developers will need to be certified)

Delivery Strategies

(how will the certification exam be delivered; how will training for the certification be delivered)

Global Considerations

(where will certification be delivered and in what languages)

Testing and Evaluation

(describe structure and content of the exam)

Development Resources

(who will be available to help develop the certification and the exam?)

Deliverables

(what materials will be developed for the certification)

Milestone Schedule

(will need to be TBD, or removed entirely)

Program Outline

(outline major subject areas to be tested)

-Language Basics
    -(identify naming and formatting conventions, ex. variable names)
-Documentation
    -Internal Documentation (code comments and associated rules)
    -External Documentation (help files, release notes, data dictionaries, etc.)
-Tools
    -(identify major classes of tools and current, broad examples of each)

Cost Estimates

(how much will it cost to develop certifications; may need to remove entirely)

Assumptions

(assumptions on cost; may need to remove)
