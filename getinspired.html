<h2>New Blog Post: I Have No Idea What I'm Doing...And That's Okay</h2>
<img src="media/marathon1.jpg" alt="A picture of Eric's face." width="300" height="448" />
<p>Some blogs are deep and insightful. Some blog writers are experts in their craft.</p>

<p>This is not that blog. I am not that writer. It's all made up and the points don't matter. Wait; scratch that last part.</p>

<p>Instead, I want to briefly celebrate not being the expert and how it can be the answer to delivering your value to your clients. If you learn anything other than this, you have probably read this blog wrong.</p>

<p>First, here's some background: "Delivering value" means what you do that helps someone out. Your "Client" is whoever receives or benefits from what you do. If you are a barista at Starbucks, the value you deliver is the finely-crafted drink you hand to your customer, who needs that drink to face the day.</p>

<p>As a technical trainer, I facilitate learning. While the course content changes from course to course, the basic goal is the same: deliver knowledge to professionals who need it. The goal is the same whether I am teaching business analytics to finance analysts or satellite communications to soldiers and marines.</p>

<!--<blockquote>In other words, I stepped out to help my clients and nailed down the details as I went.</blockquote>-->

<p>A common misconception is that trainers are experts in their field. While some are, this is not true of all of us. I have been a trainer for the last 8 years, working with railway signaling, medical device regulations, business analytics, and satellite communication. I have never walked on the job knowing much (if anything) about these highly technical fields. Instead, I started with an understanding of how people learn and used that understanding to guide my own learning. Once I understood the basics of the subject matter, I went out and taught others and also deepened my knowledge through the process of teaching. In other words, I stepped out to help my clients and nailed down the details as I went.</p>

<p>Another common misconception is that the most technical experience wins when it comes to training. The truth is that the most skill in training wins when it comes to training. Do you understand how people learn? Can you teach people in a way that makes that happen? If so, you will be far more effective than the engineers at helping people learn. And this skill can come from experience, education, or a combination of both. So having the most expertise in a subject may not be helpful or even desired when serving your clients.</p>

<p>The truth is that at this point in my career I have a bit of skill in facilitating learning. Not railway signaling, not analytics, and not SATCOM. My goal as a trainer is not to understand 100% of the subject matter. My goal is to transfer 100% of my knowledge on the subject matter to a learner. If I can do that, I am simply more effective than a subject matter expert who understands 90% of a subject and can only transfer 10% of that knowledge. If you need to see the math, here ya go: 100% of 10 = 10, 10% of 90 = 9, and therefore 10 > 9. Easy, right?</p>

<p>There are a number of advantages to not being an expert. The largest advantage is that you remember what it means to not be the expert. That means you will be able to empathize with everyone you meet because they will be as new to the subject as you were just a short time ago. Unless you have actual experts around. In which case...good luck.</p>

<p>Another advantage of not being the expert is knowing how to fail. Experts waved goodbye to basic failures early in their career, but not you. You have the blessing of several royal failures in recent memory. You have broken the system, failed to fix it, and degraded the system into oblivion until you ran screaming to the nearest expert for help. Nailed it.</p>

<p>In a previous role, I worked with an analytics platform called Tableau. As part of my onboarding, I was required to pass the Desktop Certified Associate (CA) exam. After weeks of practice and study, I proceeded to gloriously fail the exam. Once the tears, rage, and associated emotional agita had subsided, I sat down to understand what I did wrong. It turned out I ignored virtually all support resources made available to me which caused me to miss several knowledge questions. A week later, I retook the exam and passed with a respectable score. I proceeded to tell every class I taught for the next 3 years to Read the Damn Manual (RTDM).</p>

<p>While being an expert is not necessary to go out and deliver value, the actual expert can be a vital resource. Unlike us, they are the subject matter experts and can help avoid pitfalls. They are also usually in charge of projects and have a vested interest in making sure we are successful. Many are also super helpful, as long as you have the right attitude. Admitting the extent of your experience early (i.e. admitting you are not the expert) is a great way to stay on the expert's good side and continue to benefit from their expertise.</p>

<p>Let's recap: we do not create value for our clients by being experts in our fields. We create value by stepping out and providing value. As a technical trainer I created value by teaching my first class even with a basic grasp of the subject matter. I learned through teaching, listened to the needs of my students, and took as much help from the experts as I could. But I would never have reached where I am now if I had stopped to become the expert.</p>

<p>That's it. That's the secret. Go out and do what you are going to do. Waiting until you are an expert will only slow you down, will not expose you to people who can help you, and might ultimately get between your service and your client. The shortest distance between your value and your clients' needs is and always will be a straight line, so get moving. Your clients are waiting.</p>
